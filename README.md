This is a collection of the public documentation of the CSSS availble to everyone. In this repository, you will find the latest CSSS Constitution, Newsletters, Policies, and information to request CSIL bookings.

# CSIL Booking
All groups or individuals looking to book the Computing Science Instructional Labs (CSIL) must complete the form **Proposal for SFU CSIL Lab Use.docx** and submit it to **csss-exec@sfu.ca** as an attachment. The CSSS exec team will do their best to respond to you within 2 business days.

Please review the form before submission, as the requirements and details may change without warning. Please note that only official SFSS recognized clubs may request CSIL bookings, unless you are an independent group/organisation with a sponsor from within the Faculty of Applied Sciences.

By submitting this proposal, you agree that you will be held responsible for the validity of the information provided. If information is found to be intentionally false, the CSSS reserves the right to deny all future proposals. You are responsible, as the person submitting this proposal, for all damages or accidents generated during the event, or caused by the event. This includes, but is not limited to damages to: electronic equipment, AV equipment, CSIL lab equipment, CSIL lab furniture, and all properties owned by the Simon Fraser University that was either present during the event or was lent to you. You acknowledge and agree to uphold all relevant CSIL Lab rules set forth by the SFU School of Computing Science, and you are responsible for enforcing these rules on your participants.
